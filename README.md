# Baby-Copilot

Baby-Copilot :airplane: :baby: is an AI system that can autonomously fix and improve your code! No more pulling your hair out over syntax errors or spending hours debugging. Just sit back, relax, and let the AI do the heavy lifting :tropical_drink:. 

Disclaimer: This project is meant as a proof-of-concept to showcase how to programmaticaly interface with language model instances and compose programs partly expressed in natural language. Expect bugs and errors :bug:, those LLMs are capricious.


## Usage
    
Manual mode:

```bash
$ python baby-copilot.py -f <file> 
```

AI override:

```bash
$ python baby-copilot.py -f <file> -a -y
```
